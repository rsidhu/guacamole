##Javascript Whack-a-mole lab!

This is your last plain JS lab :( <br>

You task is to create a whack-a-mole game. The idea is to pull together a lot of the JS you have already learned, and to get you used to building a clickable game board that could be used for another kind of game...<br>

You will likely need to use...

* document.getElementById()
* document.getElementsByClassName()
* object.innerHTML = "we can add text or raw HTML here"
* object.addEventListener('click', function(){
	// this function runs whenever the DOM element is clicked
})
